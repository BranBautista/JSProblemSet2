    <h1>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</h1>
    <h2>Chapter six</h2>
    <p>The TV set boomed; descending the great empty apartment building's dust-stricken stairs to the
        level below, John Isidore made out now the familiar voice of Buster Friendly, burbling happily to his
        system-wide vast audience.
         " - ho ho, folks! Zip click zip! Time for a brief note on tomorrow's weather; first the Eastern
        seaboard of the U.S.A. Mongoose satellite reports that fallout will be especially pronounced toward
        noon and then will taper off. So all you dear folks who'll be venturing out ought to wait until
        afternoon, eh? And speaking of waiting, it's now only ten hours 'til that big piece of news, my special
        expos√©! Tell your friends to watch! I'm revealing something that'll amaze you. Now, you might guess
        that it's just the usual - "
         As Isidore knocked on the apartment door the television died immediately into nonbeing. It had
        not merely become silent; it had stopped existing, scared into its grave by his knock.
         He sensed, behind the closed door, the presence of life, beyond that of the TV. His straining
        faculties manufactured or else picked up a haunted, tongueless fear, by someone retreating from him,
        someone blown back to the farthest wall of the apartment in an attempt to evade him.</p>
